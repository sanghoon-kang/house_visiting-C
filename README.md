# Contextual House-Visiting Task

Adapted from Gera et al. (2019)'s task.

Some required files, including the movie file for the filler task, are too large for github. Please contact me at young950814@snu.ac.kr to acquire additional files.

Running 'task_pupil.py' requires the iMotions software with appropriate eye-tracking device. When not using pupillometry, refer to 'task_nopupil.py'.
